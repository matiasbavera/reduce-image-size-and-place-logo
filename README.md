# reduce-image-size-and-place-logo

### How to install

`pip install -r requirements`

### How to run

Rename your profile picture, to `background.(png|jpeg)` (As a suggestion, you can place the logo image and the background image on the root folder) and run:

`python super_impose.py`

This will generate a new png file with the impose image.
